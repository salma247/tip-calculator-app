## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
See the final result here: https://salma247.github.io/tip-calculator-app/

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The app is able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person.

Languges used in this app: HTML, CSS, JS, and bootstrap

I love receiving feedback! I am always looking to improve. So if you have anything you'd like to mention.
